                <p>

                    It is also known as the isolated Hajj, Hajj-ul-Ifrad is performed by the residents of Miqat, haram,
                    and Jeddah. While the pilgrims do wear ihram, they do so only to perform Hajj, not to perform Umrah.
                    It is this intention that differentiates Hajj-ul-Ifrad from the rest of the forms of Hajj, both of
                    which involve Umrah. <br>

                    As a Mufrid, you are not supposed to exit the state of ihram until you’re done throwing stones at
                    Jamarat. The practice of stoning Jamrah Al Aqabah is performed on the day of Eid. Although you are
                    not required to offer animal sacrifice when performing Hajj-ul-Ifrad, you may do so if you want to.

                    Hajj-ul-Qiran is truly a blessing for Muslims who live far away from the sacred Mosque, Masjid
                    al-Haram. It allows them to perform both Hajj and Umrah in a single visit. In fact, the Qarin (a
                    person who performs Hajj-ul-Qiran) must enter the state of ihram with the intention to perform both
                    Hajj and Umrah.
                    <br>
                    The pilgrim is supposed to perform Umrah first and then proceed for Hajj. Regardless of the length
                    of duration between the two rituals, the Qarin must perform Hajj and Umrah in the same ihram.
                    <br>
                    Upon arriving at Masjid al-Haram, Makkah, the pilgrim begins with Tawaf and Sai’e, the two key
                    rituals Umrah. After performing Umrah, you should not clip your hair or shave until you’ve performed
                    Hajj and offered animal sacrifice. Keep in mind that animal sacrifice is a mandatory in
                    Hajj-ul-Qiran, unlike the case for Hajj-ul-Ifrad.
                    <br> <br>
                    <strong> Hajj-ul-Tamattu </strong><br>

                    Hajj-ul-Tamattu is the third type of Hajj, and the person performing this Hajj is referred to as
                    Mutamatti. Again, the pilgrim is supposed to perform Umrah before Hajj, but he is not obliged to
                    perform the two rituals in the same ihram. <br> <br>

                    A Mutamatti enters the state of Ihram with the intention of performing Umrah only. Once the Umrah is
                    performed, the pilgrim exits the state of Ihram and put on a new Ihram when proceeding to Hajj on
                    the 8th of Dhul-Hijjah. This way, the pilgrim is relieved of the restrictions imposed by Ihram
                    during the time between Umrah and Hajj. <br> <br>

                    t’s important to understand here that Umrah must be performed during the Hajj season. Any Umrah that
                    is performed before the start of Shawwal or during the days of Hajj is considered invalid. Also,
                    anyone who performs Umrah as part of Hajj-ul-Tamattu can’t leave without performing Hajj. No matter
                    what, they must perform Hajj before going back to their destinations. <br> <br>

                    As in the case of Hajj-ul-Qiran, a pilgrim must offer animal sacrifice when performing
                    Hajj-ul-Tamattu. If for some reason, you can’t offer animal sacrifice, you must do a 10-day fasting
                    as a substitute. However, do not fast during the day of Eid-ul-Adha; it’s forbidden to fast on any
                    of the Eid days.

                performed? <span

            <div class="panel">
                <p>
                    Hajj Tamattu is the most type of Hajj that is performed by the pilgrims. It is performed as briefly
                    narrated hereunder;

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Preparation and Intention</strong> – You need to make niyyah or intention to perform
                        Hajj.</li>
                    <li>You need to put on Ihram and recite Talmiyah at least once.</li>
                    <li>When you reach Makkah, you need to first perform Umrah which starts with Tawaf. Tawaf is when
                        the pilgrim walks in circles around the Kaa'bah. This is done in an anti-clockwise motion. A
                        single Tawaf consists of seven complete circles. You can offer voluntary prayers to thank Allah
                        (SWT) for reaching safely and to begin this
                        special journey.</li>
                    <li>After Tawaf, you need to perform Sai, meaning walking and running particularly between the two
                        hills of Safa and Marwa.</li>
                    <li>After Sai, the men need to get their hair clipped or shaved. Women will clip their hair to the
                        length of their fingertip. When this is done, the Umrah is completed. You can now remove Ihram
                        until the 8th of Zil Hajj.
                        In the intervening period, you may perform Tawaf, offer prayers, and seek mercy from Almighty
                        Allah.</li>
                    <li>On the 8th day of Zil Hajj, you will again put on Ihram, marking the start of the days of Hajj.
                        It will be the next stage of the spiritual journey.</li>
                    <li>You will go to your allocated tent in Mina. Here, you will pray and offer prayers for Dhuhr,
                        Asr, Maghrib, Isha, and Fajr. You will spend the night in Mina and leave for Arafat after
                        offering Fajr prayers.</li>
                    <li>After sunrise, you will go to the plains of Arafat. You will recite Istaghfar and make
                        supplications.</li>
                    <li>After sunset, you will leave Arafat and head to Muzdalifah. When you reach Muzdalifah, you need
                        to offer Maghrib and Isha Salah. You can also collect small pebbles here to perform Rami. In
                        total, you will require 49 pebbles for the 10th, 11th, and 12th of Zil Hajj.</li>
                    <li>The 10th of Zil Hajj is the Day of Sacrifice. After performing Rami, you will
                        offer Qurbani.</li>
                    <li>After Qurbani, you will shave or trim the hair if you are a man. A woman will trim her hair to
                        the length of a fingertip. You will come out of Ihram restrictions and perform Tawaf-e-Ziarat.
                    </li>
                    <li>On the 11th of Zil Hajj, you will carry out the second day of Rami.</li>
                    <li>Third day or Rami- On the afternoon of the 12th of Zil Hajj will be the final stoning day..</li>
                    <li>From 10th to 12th Zil Hajj, spend as much time as possible in your tent in Mina.</li>

                </ol>

                <strong>Tawaf al-Wida</strong> – This Tawaf will be performed before leaving the boundaries of
                the Haram.

            <div class="panel">

                    The Saudi Hajj ministry has allowed women to perform the pilgrimage without a male relative or
                    Mehram. This is if they go in a group

            <button class="accordion">Q: What are the main considerations in choosing on travelling to Madinah before
                Hajj or after Hajj? <span
                class="icon">+</span> 
            </button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>
                    This largely depends on individual preference. One of the considerations may be the ease of
                    travelling, especially for those with flight time of over 6-8 hours. If you are travelling to
                    Madinah before Hajj you don’t need to be in the state of Ihram and your travelling is quite similar
                    to a regular international travel. Apart from this convenience, it is comparatively easy and quicker
                    at Madinah Airport to get through immigration, collect luggage and to arrange private pickups as
                    compare to Makkah / Jeddah Airport.
                    <br> <br>
                    If you choose Madinah after Hajj, you might face more challenges. There’s more paperwork, and you’ll
                    need to travel for about 2 hours to reach Mecca. After arrival, you might have to wait at the
                    terminal for 2 to 3 hours after immigration and getting your luggage. Private transportation options
                    can be tricky to manage in Jeddah, and is expensive as well.
                    <br> <br>
                    However, this decision remains linked with specific requirement of the pilgrim and the package that
                    is selected for performance of Hajj. At Riaz we offer packages for both <strong> “Madinah
                        before Hajj”</strong>
                    and <strong> “Madinah after Hajj”</strong> to cater varying requirements of our valued guests.

            <div class="panel">
                <p>
                    There may be three types of Qurbani;
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Hajj Qurbani.</strong> </li>

                    <li><strong>Eid Qurbani.</strong> </li>

                </ol>
                <ol>
                    <li>Kindly note none of the Hajj packages offered by Riaz Travels includes Qurbani. However, Riaz
                        Travels do
                        provide assistance, if requested by guest, in extending Qurbani services at an additional cost.
                        Qurbani is obligatory for Hajj-e-Qiran and Hajj-e-Tamattu.</li>
                    <li>
                        On the 10th of Zil Hajj, the Qurbani is offered. Hujjaj who have chosen Riaz Travels Qurbani
                        service
                        are recommended to complete the Rami on the first day by 11 am or earlier as the standard
                        duration for the Qurbani process is approximately 6 hours. Hujjaj have the flexibility to make
                        independent arrangements for Hajj Qurbani from a reputable source.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the Rami on the first day is completed after 4 pm, the Qurbani is rescheduled for the 11th of
                        Zil Hajj.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Riaz Travels also provides assistance for Dum Qurbani, which is a precautionary measure against
                        any
                        error / omission done in the state of Ihram. Dum Qurbani is offered after the 14th of Zil Hajj
                        and should be completed within a week in the Makkah region, as Dum Qurbani must be performed
                        within Makkah Regional Limits.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    The last type, Eid Qurbani, is something that Hujjaj can arrange in their home countries. However,
                    Riaz Travels may provide assistance at additional cost if the guest wants to do Eid Qurbani in
                    Makkah.

                    On the 9th Zil Hajj, the pilgrims have to reach Arafat before noon Here they offer supplications,
                    repent for sins they have committed, seek the mercy of Allah and listen to the sermon delivered by
                    Islamic scholars. They stay in Arafat from noon till sunset, known as wuquf. It is said to be one of
                    the most important rites of Hajj. The pilgrims need to spend the afternoon in Arafat or else the
                    Hajj is regarded as being invalid. The pilgrims leave Arafat before Maghrib prayers and offer
                    Maghrib and Isha prayers in Muzdalifah

                    There are some recommended Duas that you can read while circling around the Holy Kaaba.

                    Riaz Travels Hajj Group choose the locations of Azizia accommodations very carefully. One of the
                    things
                    Riaz Travels Hajj Group consider is making it easy for you to reach the Jamarat bus station and
                    escalators. You only have to walk to this station or point twice to perform Ramy. Hajj.
                    <br><br>
                    Riaz Travels Hajj Group’s accommodations are in a good spot that’s convenient for daily activities,
                    traffic flow to the Haram, and getting taxis or other transportation. On the 10th and 11th days of
                    Zil Hajj, when you need to go to the Jamarat escalators or the Jamarat bus station, it’s a short
                    walk. For older folks and kids, Riaz Travels Hajj Group has handy carts and air-conditioned vans
                    (subject to approvals) to help you cover this short distance of a few hundred meters.

                    New pilgrims often have a question: “How do we get from Azizia to the Haram for our daily prayers?”
                    Well, Riaz Travels Hajj Group has made it simple. They’ve set up a special bus service just for
                    this,
                    and you can find the schedule on boards and screens. Here’s how it works: All the buses take you to
                    a certain point. From there, you switch to buses that go right to the Haram through a tunnel. This
                    is how you get there and back. The bus service goes until the 4th of Zil Hajj and then starts up
                    again after the 14th of Zil Hajj. This follows the local rules, so you can easily reach the Haram
                    for your daily prayers.
                    <br><br>
                    Now, if you don’t want to take the bus, you have other choices. You can get to the Haram by taxi,
                    Careem, Uber, or even Makkah’s public transport. There’s an app you can use to manage this. When you
                    hop in a taxi, just tell the driver to drop you under the Ajyad tunnel, which is a well-known spot
                    above the tunnel gate called Abdul Aziz of Haram. Taxi prices can vary, and you can usually
                    negotiate. On average, it might cost around SAR50 to SAR100 each way. But during the busiest Hajj
                    days (the 10th, 11th, and 12th of Zil Hajj), some taxi drivers might charge SAR50 to SAR100 per
                    person for those days.
                    <br><br>
                    Usually, between the 10th and 12th of Zil Hajj, most pilgrims (hujjaj) make a single visit to the
                    Haram for Tawaf-e-Ziarat. If you’ve opted for Ar Rahim one-way bus service to the Haram’s Bus
                    Terminal on the 10th or 11th Zil Hajj (subject to availability, and this service is not included in
                    the package cost), you will only need to cover the expense of a one-way taxi ride back to your
                    Azizia accommodation. To be on the safe side, it’s a good idea to budget around USD$100 per person
                    for potential taxi expenses from the 5th to the 13th of Zil Hajj. Also, it’s always prudent to have
                    some extra cash on hand.

                    <strong> Tawaf-e-Ziarat: </strong>Tawaf-e-Ziarat, also known as the “Tawaf of Ifadah,” is an
                    obligation (one of Faraiz) for all Hajj pilgrims. This significant ritual occurs on the 10th, 11th,
                    or even the 12th of Zil Hajj, before sunset. After returning from Muzdalifah, many pilgrims follow a
                    specific sequence of rites, including symbolic stoning of the devil (Rami) on the first day,
                    offering Hajj Qurbani (animal sacrifice), getting a haircut, and removing the Ihram. Following these
                    steps, pilgrims perform Tawaf-e-Ziarat, which can be done while wearing regular clothing. After
                    Tawaf-e-Ziarat, it’s customary for pilgrims to engage in Sa’i, the ritual walks between Safa and
                    Marwah.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong> Tawaf-e-Wida:</strong> Tawaf-e-Vida, known as the Farewell Tawaf as well, is conducted as
                    pilgrims prepare to
                    depart from Makkah, marking the conclusion of their Hajj pilgrimage. This Tawaf takes place after
                    all other Hajj rituals have been fulfilled. Unlike other specific days, there is no set day for
                    Tawaf-e-Wida; it can be performed during the pilgrim’s final visit to the Kaaba before leaving
                    Makkah.

                    Upon your arrival at your hotel or accommodation in Makkah, here is a straightforward guide for your

                <ol>
                    <li>When you arrive in Makkah, you need to be in the state of Ihram, whether you’re coming from
                        Medina or Jeddah. This is done before crossing the Miqat zone. </li>
                    <li>You’ll be taken to your first accommodation in Makkah, which could be a hotel near the Haram or
                        Azizia, depending on your package. </li>
                    <li>Your luggage may take around 5 to 6 hours to reach your room. During this time, rest, have a
                        snack, or make up for any missed prayers.</li>
                    <li>
                        We suggest doing your first Umrah after the Eisha prayer, around 9 pm. At this time, the Haram
                        is less crowded, and there are shorter prayer lines. To complete Umrah, you’ll need to do Tawaf
                        and Sa’i.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you’re in Azizia and want to return to your accommodation, note the location and landmarks to
                        guide the taxi driver. Have a map and important contact numbers on hand, including your group
                        coordinator’s number for assistance.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    This makes your first Umrah experience smoother and more fulfilling.

                        and offer Zikr. This is stay is referred to as “waqoof-e-Arafat” time, which starts at noon and
                        goes until sunset. It’s a very important ritual, often called “Hajj Day.”

                        <strong>Muzdalifah:</strong> After leaving Arafat, pilgrims spend the night of 10th Zil Hajj in
                        Muzdalifah. This night is spent in the open sky by the roadside with very limited facilities.
                        They collect between minimum 49 or maximum 70 pebbles during this time for a special ritual. On
                        this night, they combine their Maghrib (evening) and Isha (night) prayers. The Maghrib prayer is
                        offered, which they didn’t do in Arafat. Then they wait until the Fajr (dawn) prayers, perform
                        the Fajr prayer, and proceed to stoning of Jamarat.

                <p>
                    Arafat day is a most important part of the Hajj, on the 9th of Zil Hajj. Pilgrims remain in Arafat
                    from noon till sunset of the 9th Zil Hajj. This stay is referred to as “waqoof-e-Arafat,” it’s
                    preferrable for pilgrims to arrive in Arafat early in the morning of the 9th of Dhul-Hijjah or, at
                    the latest, before noon.
                    <br><br>
                    For Category A, buses typically commence their journey at 4 am, right after Fajr prayers and before
                    sunrise. However, this timing may be adjusted per local regulations and traffic conditions.
                    <br><br>
                    In Categories B, C, and D, the journey from Mina to Arafat starts after dinner and Isha prayers of
                    8th Zil Hajj, generally at around 11 pm. The purpose is to ensure that all pilgrims reach the Arafat
                    camps well in advance of the Fajr prayers. This early arrival allows them to rest before and after
                    Fajr, preparing for their worship starting at noon. Buses are conveniently parked near the Arafat
                    camps. Moving during the night offers certain advantages, such as reduced traffic and additional
                    time to reach Arafat. In Category A, the possibility of departing after Fajr depends on local
                    conditions and permissions

                        For those who can’t sit on the ground, it is recommended to bring a light wheelchair, portable

                        Category A pilgrims can also bring additional comfort items, but they need to consider the
                        responsibility of carrying these items during the journey.

                    It’s essential to be mentally prepared for this unique and challenging experience. After spending
                    two days in the state of ihram following their journey from Mina and Arafat, pilgrims may find
                    staying on the roadside with small rocks and buses moving around to be unsettling. However, by
                    discussing their expectations with riaz travels representatives or seeking advice from those who have
                    experienced Muzdalifah before, pilgrims can better prepare themselves.

                        Toilets are limited, so pilgrims are advised to keep their meals light.

                        Consider carrying items like biscuits, energy bars, and necessary vitamins for convenience.

                        Note that Muzdalifah is a temporary setup, and there’s no specific location allocation for each

                    <li>
                        Riaz Travels strategy is to transfer pilgrims from Muzdalifah to Azizia accommodation to avoid
                        congestion in Mina, especially on the first day when all pilgrims head to the Jamarat.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This strategy ensures a smoother Rami (stoning of the pillars) for Day 1 with reduced rush

                    Please note that Jamarat bus service can be unpredictable due to rush and bus availability, without

                    Handling of Pakistani Passports during the entire Hajj journey / trip involves unique international
                    travel procedures:
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Hajj pilgrims (Hujjaj) may notice that Saudi authorities handle passports of different nationalities
                    differently. Our focused and below guidelines and procedures are based on Pakistani Machine Readable
                    Passport with Valid Hajj Visa Only.
                </p><br>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Upon arrival in Saudi Arabia as a Hajj passenger, you’ll encounter a distinct process. This
                        includes receiving polio drops and a warm welcome from immigration officials, creating a sense
                        of Saudi hospitality and the special “Ya Hajji” feeling.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Luggage handling is notably organized, with efficient porters ensuring the swift movement of
                        your belongings. It’s advisable to ensure to labelled your bags with riaz travels Luggage Cards.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After immigration and collecting your luggage, a Saudi team will identify you based on your
                        Maktab number and group name (like Riaz Travels). They will prepare the necessary documents and
                        collect your passport, which they will safeguard.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Some pilgrims might refer to the experiences of their relatives or friends who have held onto
                        their passports during Hajj and have traveled with different groups.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        However, it’s important to understand that Riaz Travels or any other group does not set the
                        condition to hold and submit passports to the relevant department in Medina and Makkah (Mecca).
                        These are local guidelines and mandatory conditions set by Saudi authorities for Hajj visas.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If any other group or individual passenger holds Pakistani passports and does not submit them to
                        the relevant department, specifically for Hajj visas, it is considered illegal and may lead to
                        issues during Hajj or in the future when records are retrieved.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Since passport handling is unique and time consuming, be mentally prepared for a journey that
                        would typically take 1.5 hours, like the one from Jeddah to Makkah (Mecca) after luggage
                        counters. During Hajj, it can take 4 to 5 hours.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Whether you arrive in Medina or Jeddah, your passport remains under the custody of a designated
                        authority or driver. They will issue a hand band and /or a card against your passport.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Depending on your Hajj plan, riaz travels team will manage the transfer of your passport to train
                        stations, buses for travel between Medina and Makkah (Mecca), or airports.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Saudi authorities are generally efficient and responsible when it comes to handling passports.
                        It’s advisable to keep a complete scan of each page of your passport as a record, which can be
                        handy.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It is important to follow Saudi procedures, and avoiding passport submission to the authorities
                        is not recommended. Passports are scanned at various points, and your movements are tracked by
                        local authorities, ensuring compliance with legal requirements.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    In short, handling of Pakistani passports during Hajj follows specific Saudi guidelines and is a
                    legal requirement for the pilgrimage. It’s important to adhere to these guidelines to ensure a
                    smooth and trouble-free Hajj experience. Nonetheless, maintaining a scanned copy of your passport
                    and complying with necessary procedures will contribute to a smooth Hajj experience.

                    Hajj packages are typically categorized into two main subcategories: shifting (fix Azizia) packages
                    and non-shifting (fix Makkah hotel) packages. Within these categories, pilgrims are presented with a
                    diverse array of options to suit their varying budgets, preferences, and specific requirements.
                    These choices encompass factors such as the type of accommodation, budget constraints, room
                    preferences, hotel star ratings, service quality, and proximity to the Haram. Pilgrims carefully
                    select from these options based on their individual preferences, financial considerations, and any
                    recommendations they may have received. Additionally, further categorization occurs based on Maktab
                    categories, which are tailored to specific Mashair Hajj days.

                        is 6-9 KM from Haram or the Hujaj are provided 2-3 nights’ stay in Hotels in close proximity to
                        Haram and the rest of Makkah stay is provided in Azizia region. This is offered in various

                    <li>
                        Pilgrims opting for shifting packages need to use transportation like taxis and shuttle services
                        to reach the Haram for prayers, managing their timing accordingly.
                    </li>

                        During the peak days from the 5th to the 14th of Zilhajj, all pre-paid shuttle services are
                        closed, and only taxis and cabs are available, which may result in additional / higher
                        transportation costs for the pilgrims.
